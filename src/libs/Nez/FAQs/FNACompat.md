FNA Compatibility
==========
To make getting up and running with FNA easier there is a separate branch along with a simple demo project (FNATester) that has the MonoGame Content Builder wired up to work with FNA. Note that you still have to install the required FNA native libs per the [FNA documentation](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA/wiki/1:-Download-and-Update-FNA). The [MonoGameCompat class](https://github.com/prime31/Nez/blob/62bbcca5e346413cacc2c3f9e765e11ead568de5/Nez-PCL/Utils/MonoGameCompat.cs) is included as well and consists of a few extension methods that implmement some commonly used method that are in MonoGame but not in FNA.

Here is what you need to do to get up and running with Nez + FNA:

- clone this repo recursively
- switch to the Nez.FNA branch (you may need to update the FNA submodules via `git submodule update`)
- open the Nez solution and build it
- open your project add a reference to the Nez.FNA project


### (optional) Pipeline Tool setup for access to the Nez content importers
If you want to use the Nez content importers follow the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/prime31/Nez/blob/master/README.md#optional-pipeline-tool-setup-for-access-to-the-nez-pipeline-importers)
